The purpose of this code is to send predefined 3-bytes code using coding format that PT2262 IC does.
PT2262 generates a specific serial data stream that is transmitted and can only be decoded 
by a PT2272 decoder. When a match if found, it can be used to do specific actions (open door, disable alarm, etc).

One application here is to detect motion sensor by using a FIR sensor.
